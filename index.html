<p>The MPSTME GNU/Linux User Group (GLUG) is a libre organisation which provides support and education for both the GNU/Linux novice and the aficionado. Primarily, the group meets in person, but support is also provided on-line through Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p>GLUG is primarily focused on hobbyist users and professionals who are engaged in self- directed study. 
The GLUG is not a committee, but a group of fervent enthusiasts willing to promote GNU/Linux and spread awareness about libre software among the students and faculty in the institute.</p>

<p>We function as a group and there is no hierarchical classification of members in the GLUG.
The GLUG aim to build a culture of self-motivated learning and professional software development on industry standard technologies.</p>

      <p>A good command line interface is a marvelously expressive way of communicating with a computer in much the same way the written word is for human beings. The workshop was an internal event.
